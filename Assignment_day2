6 BEST DESIGNED WEBSITES OF 2023

1. Girlboss:-
        Built with Shopify, Girlboss – in its own words – is a “modern media company providing women all over the world with the tools 
        and mindset to succeed.” That all starts in one place (its website!) and here, the design is as inspiring as the contents.

2. Swab the World:-
        Swab the World is an organization with a noble, unique cause – empowering patients who require stem cell donations, through technology
        and media, to recruit suitable donors – and it has a unique, beautifully designed website to match.
        Filled with images and videos of people – to humanize those the organization supports – the site also sports an extremely engaging design.
        There are CTAs that rotate across the screen in time with your cursor; colors that change, blinking, every second; text that slides in, then
        out, of frame.

3. Bod Drinks:-
       Built with popular website builder Wix, Bod Drinks specializes in “functional drinks” – probiotic sodas good for body and mind.
       Design-wise, Bod Drinks’ website channels the rejuvenating, restorative principles of its wares by leaning heavily on white space – with 
       close-up images of its drinks, and their ingredients, fading in and out of frame.

4. Apple:-
       There are few brands as synonymous with sleek design as Apple. Apple plays with the idea of minimalism, but doesn’t fully commit, adding a 
       few extradesign elements – like pictures and moving menus – that aren’t strictly necessary, but still engaging and enticing.

       We spoke to Ganesh, a Senior UX Architect, who said he loved Apple’s “hyper-realistic, sensational images taken from quirky angles to promote
       their products.” He also said “it’s the unique lighting that really makes the iPhones jump out on their website.”

       Its use of soft colors is complemented by their incredibly high quality images. Apple’s products can look better online than they do in real
       life, which might be one of the reasons that it’s such a successful company.

5. Fat Choy:-
       Built with Squarespace – a website builder well-known for its ability to produce stunningly designed websites – Fat Choy‘s website doesn’t 
       disappoint.

       Flaunting a backdrop filled with hand-drawn, cartoonish imagery – and the claim that the New York-based Asian-inspired restaurant is “kind of
       Chinese; also vegan” – Fat Choy’s website channels a playful style that never takes itself too seriously.

6. Egg Shop:-
       It’s not just tech that can benefit from well-thought-out photography, either. Egg Shop uses photographs of its recipes that can make anyone’s 
       mouth water – and is living proof that you don’t need to be a tech pro to build a beautiful site.
